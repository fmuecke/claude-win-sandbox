# claude-win-sandbox

Run **Claude Code** on Windows under a dedicated low-privilege user, inside a
Visual Studio Developer Shell, scoped to a fixed workspace directory — **without
Docker and without WSL.**

This fills a gap: existing Claude Code sandboxing projects are all Docker- or
WSL/bubblewrap-based. None of them work for the **Windows-native + MSVC + on-prem
toolchain** stack common in embedded, automotive, industrial, and enterprise C++
shops. This project is for that case.

> **Threat model:** This is **blast-radius reduction**, not hard containment.
> It defends against agent mistakes and prompt-injection overreach on a machine
> you basically trust. It is **not** a security boundary against a determined
> attacker who already has your privileges. For hard isolation, use a VM. See
> [Limitations](#limitations).


## What it does

1. **`Setup-ClaudeSandbox.ps1`** (run once, elevated)
   - Creates a low-privilege local user (`ClaudeSandbox`) if absent
   - Hardens it: denies network + RDP logon, password never-expires /
     user-cannot-change, hidden from the login screen. **Interactive logon is
     left enabled on purpose** — the launcher uses it; denying it breaks launch.
   - Prompts for the workspace base directory, defaulting to `C:\dev`, then
     creates `C:\dev\ClaudeSandbox` and grants `ClaudeSandbox` Modify on that tree
   - Verifies your profile isn't readable by Users/Everyone (a Standard user is
     denied your profile by default — the script warns if yours is misconfigured)
   - Adds account-scoped outbound firewall blocks for common Windows
     file-sharing and remote-admin ports (`137-139`, `445`, `135`, `3389`,
     `5985-5986`) while leaving web/HTTPS access available for Claude, git, and
     internal services
   - Writes `C:\ProgramData\claude-win-sandbox\config.json` with the sandbox
     path and setup metadata, locates VS Developer Shell + git, copies the Dev
     Shell bootstrap into
     `C:\ProgramData\claude-win-sandbox\bootstrap\`, and locks those ProgramData
     artifacts admin-write / Users-RX
   - Can create a Public Desktop shortcut that launches the sandbox

2. **`managed-settings.json`** (copy once, elevated)
   - Enterprise Claude Code policy: denies obvious secret reads, disables
     bypass-permissions mode, pre-approves routine git + build verbs
   - Copy to `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\` and lock it (see setup below)

3. **`Remove-ClaudeSandbox.ps1`** (run for teardown, elevated)
   - Removes the `ClaudeSandbox` local user and profile, account-scoped firewall
     rules, hidden-login-screen registry value, generated
     `C:\ProgramData\claude-win-sandbox\` files, optional Public Desktop
     shortcut
   - Does **not** delete or modify the shared workspace directory or its ACLs.
     Delete it manually only after reviewing that it contains nothing you still
     need.

4. **`Start-ClaudeSandbox.ps1`** (run per session, normal priv)
   - Prompts for the `ClaudeSandbox` password (via `runas`)
   - Launches a new console as `ClaudeSandbox`, in the Dev Shell, `cd`'d to the
     sandbox path stored in `C:\ProgramData\claude-win-sandbox\config.json`
   - The bootstrap warns at launch if the sandbox profile has current
     mapped drives, persistent mapped-drive entries, or saved Network Shortcuts
   - You type `claude` and go

5. **`Check-ClaudeSandbox.ps1`** (run anytime, read-only)
   - Verifies the whole setup: config valid and locked, user exists & is
     non-admin, hardening applied, outbound firewall rules are present and
     scoped to `ClaudeSandbox`, workspace ACLs, your profile isn't exposed,
     bootstrap present + locked, toolchain present, Claude installed per-user
     (and *not* leaking in from elsewhere), policy file valid and admin-locked
   - Prints PASS/WARN/FAIL; exits non-zero on any FAIL. Run elevated for full
     coverage (user-rights + HKLM + other-profile checks). Doubles as a
     post-launch diagnostic.


## Why a separate user (and not just sandbox flags)

Claude Code runs with **your** OS privileges by default — it can read anything
you can: env vars, SSH keys, PATs, credential stores. On Windows, Anthropic's
native bubblewrap sandbox **isn't available yet** (WSL2/Linux/macOS only). So on
native Windows the most practical OS-level boundary is a **separate low-priv
user**: the NTFS ACLs do the enforcing, and Claude Code physically can't reach
what that user can't reach.

This pairs with — doesn't replace — Claude Code's own permission system and the
managed-settings deny rules. Defense in depth:

| Layer | What it stops | Enforced by |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| NTFS ACLs (low-priv user) | Reading/writing your secrets & system dirs | Windows kernel |
| `managed-settings.json` deny rules | Agent tool calls to secret paths | Claude Code |
| Permission prompts (no bypass mode) | Unreviewed command execution | Claude Code |
| Account logon hardening | Network/RDP logon as the sandbox user | Windows user rights |
| Account-scoped firewall rules | Outbound SMB/NetBIOS/RDP/WinRM from the sandbox user | Windows Firewall |


## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11, dedicated/trusted dev machine
- Visual Studio (Pro or higher) installed machine-wide
- Git for Windows installed machine-wide
- **Claude Code installed *as the `ClaudeSandbox` user* (per-user, not
  machine-wide).** See [Installing Claude Code](#installing-claude-code).
- Admin rights for setup, removal, and policy installation


## Installing Claude Code

Claude Code **must be installed inside the `ClaudeSandbox` profile**, not
machine-wide and not in your own profile. The binary and its `~/.claude` config
live with the sandbox user so they stay inside the boundary; a machine-wide or
your-profile install can be picked up off the machine PATH, pulling binary/config
from **outside** the sandbox — exactly what the boundary is meant to prevent.

After running setup, start a sandboxed shell and install as `ClaudeSandbox`:

```powershell
.\Start-ClaudeSandbox.ps1

# in the new window (running as ClaudeSandbox):
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

This installs to `C:\Users\ClaudeSandbox\.local\bin\claude.exe`. The bootstrap
prepends that directory to PATH on every launch, so no manual PATH edit or
restart is needed — just reopen the shell. `Check-ClaudeSandbox.ps1` verifies the
per-user install is present and warns if a copy exists elsewhere.


## Setup

```powershell
# 1. Provision the user, ACLs, bootstrap  (ELEVATED)
.\Setup-ClaudeSandbox.ps1
#   prompts for the base directory where the ClaudeSandbox workspace folder
#   will be created; Enter accepts C:\dev
#   if the workspace folder already exists, setup asks before reusing it
#   when creating ClaudeSandbox, setup asks for the password twice

# 2. Install the Claude Code policy  (ELEVATED)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\managed-settings.json C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\ -Force
$f = 'C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json'
icacls $f /inheritance:r /grant 'Administrators:F' 'SYSTEM:F' 'Users:R'   # admin-write only

# 3. Install Claude Code AS ClaudeSandbox (see "Installing Claude Code" above)
.\Start-ClaudeSandbox.ps1
#   in the new window:  irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

# 4. Verify everything took  (ELEVATED for full coverage)
.\Check-ClaudeSandbox.ps1

# 5. First-time: log in as ClaudeSandbox once to set up its git/ADO credential
#    (scoped, minimal PAT — kept separate from yours)
```

Then, day to day (normal PowerShell, no elevation):

```powershell
.\Start-ClaudeSandbox.ps1                           # uses C:\dev\ClaudeSandbox
# or use the optional desktop shortcut created by setup
# enter ClaudeSandbox password (runas) -> new window opens -> type: claude
```

## Removal

Run the removal script from an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
.\Remove-ClaudeSandbox.ps1
```

The script removes the local sandbox account, its Windows profile including the
per-user Claude install/settings, generated `C:\ProgramData\claude-win-sandbox\`
state, account-scoped firewall rules, and optional Public Desktop shortcut.

It does **not** delete or modify the workspace directory or its ACLs, for example
`C:\dev\ClaudeSandbox`. That folder is a shared working area and may contain
repositories or files you still need. Delete it manually after review if it is no
longer needed.


## Credential handling

The launcher uses **`runas`**, which prompts for the password each launch and
opens an interactive console as `ClaudeSandbox`. `runas` is used rather than
`Start-Process -Credential` because it attaches the new process to an interactive
desktop — `Start-Process -Credential` can produce a window that renders but won't
accept keyboard input (a "hung" shell).

No password caching: the prompt is the only credential path, which keeps the tool
simple and avoids storing the password anywhere.


## Limitations

- **The boundary is Windows' default profile ACL**, not explicit deny rules.
  A Standard user can't read your profile on a correctly configured system; the
  setup script verifies this rather than patching over it with brittle deny ACEs.
  Secrets kept *outside* your profile (e.g. a vault under `C:\` or a share) aren't
  covered by that default — protect those paths' ACLs separately.
- **Claude must be installed per-user under `ClaudeSandbox`.** A machine-wide or
  your-profile install can be resolved off the machine PATH, which would pull the
  binary and `~/.claude` config from outside the boundary. The check script warns
  if it finds Claude installed anywhere other than the sandbox user.
- **No native bubblewrap on Windows.** When Anthropic ships native Windows
  sandboxing, prefer it (or stack it on top of this).
- **Managed-settings deny rules are defense-in-depth, not airtight.** Claude
  Code has had permission-bypass CVEs (symlink tricks, path resolution). Keep it
  updated.
- **`ClaudeSandbox` needs its own writable profile** for `~/.claude` config — that's
  fine; it contains none of your secrets.
- **Debugging system processes still needs elevation.** Don't run *this* elevated
  to get there. Keep agent autonomy and elevation in separate processes — run
  elevated VS for debugging (agent mode off), agentic AI here (low-priv).
- **Outbound firewall protection is operational, not strict egress isolation.**
  The setup blocks common Windows sharing and remote-admin outbound ports for
  `ClaudeSandbox`, but still allows normal web/HTTPS traffic so Claude Code,
  git, installers, package managers, and internal web services keep working. It
  does not stop exfiltration over allowed protocols such as HTTPS. Use a managed
  local proxy, network firewall, or VM if you need destination allowlisting or
  full egress isolation.
- **Mapped-drive checks are hints, not complete access proofs.** The bootstrap
  warns at launch about mapped-drive and Network Shortcut hints visible to the
  `ClaudeSandbox` session. It does not enumerate another user's Credential
  Manager entries or prove what a server will allow at connection time.

## Why not Docker / WSL?

Both are great and already well-served by other projects — use them if your
workload runs there. This project exists specifically for **native Windows
toolchains** (MSVC, classic .vcxproj, on-prem build) that can't move into a
Linux container without losing the toolchain.
