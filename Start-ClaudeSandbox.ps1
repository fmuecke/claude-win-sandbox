.SYNOPSIS
    Launches Claude Code as a low-privilege user inside a Visual Studio Developer
    Shell, scoped to the ClaudeSandbox workspace stored in ProgramData config.
    Prompts for the password each launch.

.DESCRIPTION
    Part of claude-win-sandbox. Assumes Setup-ClaudeSandbox.ps1 has provisioned
    the low-priv user, sandbox ACLs, config, and the Dev Shell bootstrap.

    Launch uses runas.exe, which attaches the new process to an interactive
    desktop for the target user so the console accepts keyboard input.
    (Start-Process -Credential can produce a window that renders but won't accept
    typing - the "hung shell".) runas prompts for the password natively.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Start-ClaudeSandbox.ps1
    Prompts for the password, launches a sandboxed Dev Shell in the workspace
    stored in the ProgramData config by setup.
